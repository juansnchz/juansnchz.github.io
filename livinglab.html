                <p>Education, one of the most fundamental human development processes has been, unfortunately, one of the few industries (if not the only one) that has undergone almost no innovation since the public schooling system became established in the late 19th century.</p>


                <span class="mreavesp-bold">Given our ever changing social, political, technological and environmental contexts, education needs to adapt to the requirements and needs of the 21st century.</span>

                <p class="mt-2">This challenge becomes more difficult in a context like Colombia, where the education system still has many problems related to dropout rates, bad academic results, hostile learning environments, lack of teacher motivation, amongst others.</p>


                <p>United Way Colombia's innovation team decided that it was necessary to change the tradional approach to delivering student programmes and focus on teachers because an empowered and motivated teacher can enhance hundreds or thousands of students’ lives during their careers.</p>

                <p>The challenge was defined as <span class="mreavesp-bold">“how can we develop 21st century skills in teachers so that they are able to transfer them to their students as well as solving design challenges in their institutions?”</span></p>

                <p>The solution for the project came as a design lab for education. In this lab, named The Living Lab (<span class="mreavesp-italic">Laboratorio Vivo </span>in Spanish) teachers experience a professional development service that allows them to innovate with their pedagogical practices, as well as solving pressing issues in their schools.
                    <br>This service (built in collaboration with multiple private and public stakeholders) works using two different, but intertwined, journeys: <span class="mreavesp-bold">the skill development journey and the solution incubator journey.</span>

                    <p>This journey aims to develop eight 21st century skills (as defined by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills):</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Creativity &amp; innovation</li>
                        <li>Communication</li>

                        <li>Problem solving</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This is done through a practice-driven approach that breaks with traditional teaching styles, such as lectures and seminars and focuses more on workshops and visible learning (John Hattie, 2008). The objetive in this journey is to show teachers different points of view regarding education and challenge them to break with pervasive paradigms that currently shape Colombian education systems.</p>

                    <p>The solution incubator journey allows teachers to experiment with a service design and design thinking approach in order to solve pressing issues from their schools. Through a series of workshops they can identify, cluster and analyze problems, as well as ideate, prototype and communicate solutions that are cost-efficient and scalable within the educator’s community. This ideas are then implemented and monitored by a mentorship service offered by the design lab thus allowing teachers to continue experimenting and generating a innovation culture in their schools.</p>

                One of the key premises of this design lab is that solution incubation and skills development must work interdependently. In practice, this means that <span class="mreavesp-bold">all of the “experiences” that participants go through during the service (at least 6 months) have two objectives: developing skills in teachers and school directors and solving problems through the use of design methodologies in schools or in the territory where it is located.</span></p>

            <p>Incubation experiences focus on Empathy, Ideation and Prototyping, whereas skills development experiences can have focus on “knowing” (incresing knowledge in a specific topic or area), doing (applying knowledge to the real world) or being (understanding what it means to be a human in the 21st century). All of these experiences are designed by experience designers which have a remarkable knowledge in their area of expertise and can also use active methodologies for transferring knowledge to others.</p>
            <h4 class="mreavesh4 psdesign my-4" style="text-align: center">Paradigm challenging cards for educators</h4>

            <p>This methodology, adapted from MIT's N-Committee cards for students, focuses on challenging educator's perspectives around education and the way these paradigms shape the reality around educational environments. Through the use of forced associations, participants can understand the importance of paradigms for designing touchpoints with which students, parents, teachers and other stakeholders must interact with. The objective is that teachers can discuss how the education system is conditioned by predominant learning theories, prevailing purposes of education and pedagogical strategies and how these manifest in school elements, for example desks in a classroom or in a class schedule. This methodology allowed them to confront these prodominant mindsets, generating fruitful discussions about how to move education forward in Colombia. The cards are organized according to the following categories:
            <dl>
                <dt class="psdesign">Theories of learning:</dt>
                <dd>
                    These cards included multiple theories that have been published throughout time. Some are now considered obsolete, others are still a matter of discussion. For example: conductism, constructivism, cognitive psychology, etc. The cards also include authors that are in favor or against these ideas.</dd>
                <dt class="psdesign">Teaching Strategies</dt>
                <dd>These cards focus on methodologies or strategies that generate an interaction between teachers and students, as well as the author(s) that propose these strategies. Some examples of these cards are: flipped learning, visible learning, problem based learning, etc.</dd>
                <dt class="psdesign">Purpose of education:</dt>
                <dd>These were perhaps the most contentious cards of the pack. These cards contained multiple and, at times, opposed views of the objectives of education. There are political and social implications for each of these, but provided new ways to answer the question "Why is there a need for education?". Some examples of these cards are: democratic participation, globalized citizenship, critical thinking, citizen standarization, etc.</dd>
                <dt class="psdesign">Elements of the school:</dt>
                <dd>These cards included all the touchpoints that a student or teacher would interact with at the school. These elements are the manifestations of specific ways of thinking and could possibly not exist if there were new ways of thinking about education. Some examples of these cards are: student evaluation, graduation requirements, classroom layout, schedules, etc.</dd>
